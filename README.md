# Work-Day-Scheduler

This work day scheduler is designed to capture and display the user's tasks for the day, between 8AM and 8PM.

The user can enter information (to-dos, meetings, tasks) into the appropriate time block and - when they click the button - the information will be saved into local storage until manually cleared.

As the day progresses, the time blocks reflect (by color) whether that time is in the past (gray), the current hour (pink), or the future (green).

The application pulls information about the current time from moment.js.
